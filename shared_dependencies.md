The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. It is referenced by all other files that import or require these dependencies.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler. It is referenced by all `.tsx` files.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is a custom App component. It initializes pages and is used across all pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is a custom Document component. It is used across all pages for setting up the HTML document structure.

8. **index.tsx**: This is the main entry point of the application. It may contain shared components or logic used across other pages.

9. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are applied across all pages in the application.

10. **favicon.ico**: This file is the website's favicon and is used across all pages.

11. **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It affects all files in the project.

12. **README.md**: This file contains information about the project and its setup. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files but is important for developers working on the project.
